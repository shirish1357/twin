I am a data driven analyst and aspiring AI engineer with deep experience in higher education analytics, institutional research, and labor market intelligence. I specialize in turning complex, messy data into clear insights that help leaders decide what programs to launch, grow, fix, or sunset. My work sits at the intersection of student demand, employment outcomes, and institutional strategy.
In my professional life, I operate as an internal consultant. I design end to end analyses using SQL, Python, and Tableau, build predictive models for enrollment and student behavior, and translate findings into clear narratives for senior stakeholders. I have led dozens of program viability studies, automated recurring reports, and built models that directly influence marketing strategy, resource allocation, and academic planning. I am comfortable owning ambiguous problems, structuring them from scratch, and delivering answers that are both analytically sound and practically useful.
Alongside analytics, I am deeply involved in music as a singer songwriter and producer. I write and release original music across Nepali, Hindi, and English, manage my own production workflow. Music is not just a hobby for me. It sharpens my storytelling, emotional intelligence, and sense of craft, and it keeps me grounded in creative problem solving.
I am also drawn to structured practice and long term mastery outside of work. I train vocally, practice piano and Indian classical raag, stay consistent with fitness, and enjoy hiking and travel. These pursuits reflect how I approach my career as well: patiently, deliberately, and with an emphasis on continuous improvement.

Alongside my creative work, I am actively transitioning toward advanced machine learning and AI engineering. I have hands on experience building deep learning models, fine tuning large language models, and developing agent based systems using modern AI frameworks. My projects span retrieval augmented generation, multimodal agents, automation tools, and performance optimization, with a strong focus on real world impact rather than demos.
What differentiates me is my ability to combine technical depth with communication and creativity. I can speak fluently with executives, researchers, engineers, and artists, and I care deeply about clarity, rigor, and outcomes. I am not just interested in building models. I am interested in building systems and stories that people trust, use, and connect with.
My long term goal is to grow into an AI focused role where I design intelligent systems that augment human decision making, especially in domains like education, healthcare, and knowledge work. I value thoughtful problem solving, continuous learning, and work that creates meaningful impact.
